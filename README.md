## Course descriptions and objectives

Software testing is to exercise the program using input data in three different space domains: (1) in the requirement and specification domain, (2) in the program implementation domain, (3) in the test input space domain.  The space covered in (1), (2), (3) will intersect one another and exhibit different properties to reveal the software defects, quality of use, and potential exploitation. Our course will cover several conventional software testing issues: 1. Functional testing, 2. Structural testing, 3. Integration and system testing. Other than these, test plans used in Microsoft and google will be discussed. Nonconventional testing like fuzzing , exploitable testing and symbolic execution will be introduced too.
